# Researcher Library Obsidian Plugin

## Project Overview

This plugin helps researchers manage their literature within Obsidian. It allows users to add PDF files of research papers, automatically extract metadata, and organize their reading list.

## Core Features

*   **PDF Import:** Add PDF files to your Obsidian vault.
*   **Metadata Extraction:** Automatically extract metadata (title, authors, publication year) from PDFs.
*   **Manual Metadata Editing:** Edit extracted metadata.
*   **Reading Status:** Track the reading status of each paper ("To Read," "Reading," "Read").
*   **Notes Integration:** Create and link notes to specific papers.

## How to Use (Planned)

Detailed instructions on how to use the plugin will go here once the features are implemented and ready for user interaction. This will include steps for installing the plugin, importing PDFs, editing metadata, and managing reading status.
